# Chrome Extensions Workshop - Step 3

## TODO
1. Create `background.js` file and set it as your background script using `background` field in the manifest. If you decide later on that you want to use some kind of a library (e.g. jQuery) on your background page, just mention it in the manifest file.
	- you can debug background pages by clicking "background page" on the "Inspect views" list on `chrome://extensions/` page

2. Add "storage" and "alarms" permission to your extension using `permissions` field in the manifest.
3. Implement these changes:
	- use alarm API on your background page to download pollution data every 60 minutes (`chrome.alarms.create()` and `chrome.alarms.onAlarm.addListener()`)
	- store downloaded data using storage API (`chrome.storage.local.set()`)
	- remove AJAX request from the popup and use data from the storage instead
	- use `chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText` and `chrome.browserAction.setBadgeBackgroundColor` to show pollution information on the browser action button

4. Done! If you have extra time left you can polish your extension. Check list of possible improvements below.

- [Alarms API](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/alarms.html)

## Extra time left?
- Show error message when there is no data in the storage.
- Remove loading animation from the popup if you had one. We don't need it since data are immediately retrieved from the storage.
- Change text in the tooltip that appears when mouse is over the browser action button. By default this tooltip shows only extension name ("SmogKrk"), but you can dynamically (same as with badges) change it to something more useful ("SmogKrk - 1 pollutant exceeds the norms").
- You can change whole icon of the browser action button dynamically and even animate it.
