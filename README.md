# Chrome Extensions Workshop - Step 1

## TODO
1. Create `popup.html` file in your extension folder
2. Add `default_popup` field to the manifest and set it to `popup.html`
3. Test your changes. After clicking browser action button small popup should appear.
4. Create and add `popup.js` and `popup.css` to your `popup.html` page. Implement the functionality presented below

	- Pull the pollution data from `http://smogalert.pl/api/stats/krakow-krasinskiego`
	- You can (but definitely don't have to) use any libraries/frameworks you wish. However, don't use external servers, download all files that you need to your extension folder.
	- You can debug your popup by right-clicking on the browser action button and choosing "Inspect Popup".
5. Done! If you have extra time left you can polish your extension. Check list of possible improvements below.

- [Manifest File Format](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest.html)

## Extra time left?
- Clean up your file structure (e.g. keep all JavaScript files in `js/` folder etc.)
- While data are being loaded show some text/animation (e.g. gif or CSS Animation).
- Make sure that user will get an error message if API is unreachable.
- Make this popup pretty! Play with styles and maybe use [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)?
